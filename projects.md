## Active Projects

**Senior Capstone Project:** *Sept 21' - Present* <br />
Project revolved around using a noSQL database, python webscraping, and creating a client side application to display this information. The project is using a combination of scrum, kanban, and agile methodologies to accomplish this project with a small team of classmates. 

**Pokemon BDSP Bingo Board** *Dec 21' - Present* <br />
Creating a randomly generating Bingo board for users to race against each other in various different races revolved around completing tasks in the Nintendo Switch games Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. 

## Backlogged Projects

**PixelMon Server** <br />
An idea I had to create a Minecraft server revolved around the Pixelmon mod trying to replicate a pokemon experience in a custom map with custom quests and more. It's a small team of friends on the project helping with world building and planning for this server.

**Aur** <br />
Unity game I have been slowly making progress too with my own pixel-art and sprite animations. I have been using this project as a slow teaching experience for myself to be able to learn the unity engine more and to improve my own art skills.
