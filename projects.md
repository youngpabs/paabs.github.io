## Backlogged Projects

**Open-Game Art Game Jam Submission** *July 21'* <br />
Game I intended on creating for the Open Game Art's Summer game jam but ran out of time! I like the idea I have had and wanna flush it out more as a mini-game experience teaching myself more about
the Unity Engine and helping myself become more comfortable developing my own things in Unity. 

**PixelMon Server** <br />
An idea I had to create a Minecraft server revolved around the Pixelmon mod trying to replicate a pokemon experience in a custom map with custom quests and more. It's a small team of friends on the project helping with world building and planning for this server.
