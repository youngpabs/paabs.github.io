This was a camp designated for kids to help introduce the topic of trajectory to kids. It was a really cool experience implimenting ways to teach kids physics on a platform like Roblox. Things not listed here are curriculum and slide deck creation for other camp counselors to teach this camp created for kids. 

**Day 1: Trajectory** <br />

The aim of the map was to create an environment to get kiddos to think about making diagrams to understand how Physicists create diagrams to solve their problems then attempt to solve it. Each court has a different obstacle that the player can make a model for and plan around how to make a basket to solve the problem, with different starting points on the ground for them to have different angles at each court.

This shot shows the players attempts at shooting through an obstacle and where their shot landed. Each red dot shows where the players shot landed so they can readjust and take another shot.

**Day 5: Physics Amusement Park** <br />

This project was to create a physics related amusement park for the kiddos to play games in throughout the rest of the last day of class. This screenshot shows the decorations of the park that I helped work on and design with a team of other people.

This screenshot shows the mini-game I designed myself as a fun reminder of the day one project. Itâ€™s a custom take on the classic moving basketball arcade game, where the player is given many balls to score as many baskets as they can while the hoop moves, and the timer counts down. The physics twist is that each ball is a planet! That has different variables of gravity depending on which ball the player picks up. Ranging from a large Jupiter gravity ball to a floaty moon ball. The hoop moves just as it would back and forth on different direction randomly until the game timer hits zero.
