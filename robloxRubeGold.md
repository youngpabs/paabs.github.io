title: Rube Goldberg Machines
permalink: /portfolio/rubegold
---

This project was a sole developer position I had for about 3-4 months. This camp was revolved around giving campers a secondary course to move onto and apply the physics they learned in the physics camp. Campers are given an electric sphere asset and a power bulb asset, where they are challenged to create a rube goldberg machine that uses the electric sphere to collide and travel their machine in order to provide enough "electrity" to power the power bulb. Assets can be found by searching for my Roblox creator name in Roblox Studios Assets: YoungPabs

**Day 1: Machine Example** <br />

These screenshots are the day 1 example campers are shown to give them ideas of what they can create as well as some of the tools they can use for their own machines! The Rube Goldberg example contains of assets I created for campers to use and a see an example of a Roblox Rube Goldberg Machine. This example map runs through different ideas of trajectory, velocity, and obstacles for their machine to have.

**Day 2: Simple Machines** <br />

This is a small map example where the campers are put into sections of the map connected by teleporters where they can test out concepts learned from physics camp and see them in action with their machine ideas. This includes looking at the domino effect, different effects of ramps, and a velocity tutorial. If you want to hop into the map you can do that [here!](https://www.roblox.com/games/8323493229/Simple-Machines)

**Day 3: Trajectory** <br />

This map is a small playground where the campers can practice their understanding of velocity and learn about trajectory by checking their understanding with target practice. They can also hop through the portal to test out the gravity example where the campers can jump around messing with the worlds gravity and see the effect is has on them. You can do this yourself [here!](https://www.roblox.com/games/8323577588/Trajectory-and-Gravity)

**Camp Assets** <br />
These gifs are examples of some of the assets the campers were given and taught how to use throughout the week. Both the ball launcher and the cannon are scripted unioned objects created to allow the campers to use the specific sphere asset to shoot around their machine. Tutorials on how to use them are found within the assets scripts themselves.
